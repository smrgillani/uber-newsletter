Please code this in hybrid with media queries for progressive enhancement.

Some things to note:

- The background should center crop rather than scale or replace on mobile.
- The top section and main gif should be two separate backgrounds. Just have the top background repeat vertically if it gets too tall with the additional cta.


Included are our web fonts, feel free to choose your own fallback fonts. Our main font is Clan Pro Book.
